    description: 'Fonts may live in our computers, but every outline of every letter, number, and symbol in a typeface is originally crafted by human hand. In the 1800s this happened via a copper plate engraving technique that allowed designers to create extravagant letters by hand, lending a uniqueness to maps and books of the time.'

    description: "Design is in flux. Where its practitioners were once expected to produce chairs, lamps, logos and letterheads, today their work is often less visible. Increasingly, design is concerned with interactions and experiences-it's about software and the vast systems that power it. We asked nine top designers to talk about their craft and what it means today."

    description: "Japanese design house Nendo can make anything better. The designers have revamped rubber bands. They tackled the 4,000-year-old design problem of chopsticks. They even figured out how to make wood transparent for crying out loud. Still, I'm always happiest when Nendo turns its design genius to crafting delicious treats."

    description: "Even though they're often just small images, logos carry a whole lot of meaning -- and designing one comes with a whole lot of responsibility, too. Logos are usually the most recognizable representation of a company or organization. And with more information available to the average consumer today, logos also have to quickly and effectively communicate on behalf of their brand."
